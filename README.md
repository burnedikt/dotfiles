# Disclaimer

These dotfiles work for me. That doesn't neccessarily mean they also work for you. For starters, they are specific to MacOS. If you're not running MacOS (El Capitan or higher), these dotfiles will not just work for you.

# Installation

These dotfiles are most easily managed using a dotfile manager like [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm).

For simplicity's sake, we'll just use GNU Stow which will also be installed automatically.

To take the quick route, just run `./install.sh` to get everything setup.

## Manual Labor

### Sublime Text Icon

The [sublime text icon](sublime/icon.icns) (all thanks goes to [Yannik Siebert](https://dribbble.com/shots/1827488-Final-Sublime-Text-Replacement-Icon)) needs to be assigned to sublime manually. Instructons on how to change an application's icon can be found [here](http://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/how-change-os-x-yosemites-icons-3597494/).
