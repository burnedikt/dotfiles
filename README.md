# Disclaimer

These dotfiles work for me. That doesn't neccessarily mean they also work for you. For starters, they are specific to MacOS. If you're not running MacOS (El Capitan or higher), these dotfiles will not just work for you.

# Installation

For handling these dotfiles, we'll use GNU Stow which will also be installed automatically, if you run the install script.

To take the quick route, just run `./install.sh` to get everything setup.

## Manual Labor

### Powerline Fonts

To have powerline enabled fonts that support a variety of icons in your terminal, make sure to go to run `fonts/install.sh`.
Then use one of the provided fonts and select it in iTerm / Terminal.app.

### Sublime Text Icon

The [sublime text icon](sublime/icon.icns) (all thanks goes to [Yannik Siebert](https://dribbble.com/shots/1827488-Final-Sublime-Text-Replacement-Icon)) needs to be assigned to sublime manually. Instructons on how to change an application's icon can be found [here](http://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/how-change-os-x-yosemites-icons-3597494/).
